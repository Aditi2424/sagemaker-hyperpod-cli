SageMaker HyperPod Command Line Interface (CLI) and Software Development Kit (SDK) provide a seamless way to manage distributed training and inference workloads on EKS-orchestrated SageMaker HyperPod clustersâ€”without needing Kubernetes expertise. Use the powerful CLI to launch and monitor training jobs and endpoints, or leverage the Python SDK to do the same programmatically with minimal code, including support for JumpStart models, custom endpoints, and built-in monitoring.
